# Pawnshop

This script was developed for Cinema Rp, Pineapple Rp, and Recovery Networks

This script will still be updated to hold multiple "stores" so seperate tables with different items.

This script was developed in less than 24 hours but it was somewhat bug tested and no method to exploit that I know of. If you find a method, please let me know!

You MUST update the config with actual locations. The locations are the one I used during development by the beach. Enjoy
